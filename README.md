# SoftSwiss Test Task

## Requirements

- Node.js v18.0.0 or higher
- npm v8.0.0 or higher

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Test Locally

After building, open the generated `dist/index.html` file directly in your browser:

- Navigate to the `dist` folder
- Double-click `index.html` or right-click and "Open with" your preferred browser

The page will load with all assets (CSS, JS, images) using relative paths, allowing it to work without a web server.

### Development Mode

For development with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens at http://localhost:3000

## Notes

- Font: The implementation uses Sofia Sans instead of Sofia Pro (which is not a free font)
